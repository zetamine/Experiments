# Experiments

This is a very, very simple app to record punches. Due to its simplicity it adhears to almost no programming principles and is a very bad example to follow. The intent is to give an idea of what can be done with the builtin Android linear accelerometer. Don't look too deeply into the coding decisions and think if this as a prototype account view of a larger, better coded app.
